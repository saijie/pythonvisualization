# Python Visualization Workshop Materials

This workshop covers a few basics of pandas, in `pandas.ipynb`, and then an introduction to `matplotlib`, in `plotting.ipynb`.  Both files are Jupyter notebooks written for Python 3.  

You can preview the notebooks by clicking on the files above. To download, click on the file, then click the raw button, and then save the file.  Or clone the whole repository (see the green Clone or Download button above).

You will need to have matplotlib, numpy, and pandas installed.
